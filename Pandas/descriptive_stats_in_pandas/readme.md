## Learning Goals
1. Use .describe() to view summary statistics
2. Use df.groupby() to aggregate statistics by a feature
3. Examine feature correlations
4. Analyze statistics to make a recommendation

Session Outline/Plan
Students guide instructor on using basic pandas functions and methods to load, clean, and join two tables, then save it.
Students are encouraged to use Pandas documentation and Google, as well as error analysis to accomplish the goal together.

Introduction (1 Mins)
Included in notebook.

### Activity 1 ~10-30 Mins? (depends on student proficiency)

Students should each have a copy of the notebook and be working along with the group.  

They should end with a functional notebook walking through the learning goals.  

## Instructions for instructors to use the materials

Use solution as guidance, but allow students to determine what the instructor enters into code cells.  
**This should be a collaborative creation, not instructor led.**
Instructor may use guiding questions to help students solve problems (

* What did you find on Google?
* What does the error say?
* Is the documentation on this helpful?

### Activity 2 (XX Mins)

If there is a lot of time left, move on to Pandas Walkthrough Part 2 (stats_in_pandas)

Conclusion (1 Mins)
Included in notebook

## Extras: 
**Save 'icecream.csv' before moving to Extras**
Also, feel free to do more manipulation of data in this notebook.

1. Subset data with df.loc[]
2. Concatenate or columns to create new features
3. Practice chaining methods
4. Practice multiple ways to get the same result:
  - Introduce 'df =' vs df.method(inplace=True)
  - Practice df['feature'] vs df.feature
5. Visualize relationships between features with df.plot()


## Tips
Don't solve it for them, let them struggle.  Show error messages and guide them toward how to read and deal with them.
There are multiple ways to reach the same goals.  Accept the students' answer, and consider whether introducing another way would be helpful or not.
