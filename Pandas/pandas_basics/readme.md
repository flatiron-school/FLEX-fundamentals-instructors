## Learning Goals
1. Loading data from disk into working memory in the form of a dataframe
2. Viewing data in the dataframe
3. Exploring the number of rows and columns, column names and data types, and any missing data
4. How to remove columns and rows with missing data.
5. How to join two dataframes together.


Session Outline/Plan
Students guide instructor on using basic pandas functions and methods to load, clean, and join two tables, then save it.
Students are encouraged to use Pandas documentation and Google, as well as error analysis to accomplish the goal together.

Introduction (1 Mins)
Included in notebook.

### Activity 1 ~10 - 30 Mins? (depends on student proficiency)

Students should each have a copy of the notebook and be working along with the group.  

They should end with a functional notebook walking through the learning goals.  

Instructions for instructors to use the materials

Use solution as guidance, but allow students to determine what the instructor enters into code cells.  
This should be a collaborative creation, not instructor led.


### Activity 2 (10-30 Mins)

If there is a lot of time left, move on to [Pandas Descriptive Statistics](https://github.com/Caellwyn/FLEX-Sessions/tree/main/Fundamentals/Pandas/stats_in_pandas)

Conclusion (1 Mins)
Included in notebook

## Extras: 
**Save 'icecream.csv' before moving to Extras**
Also, feel free to do more manipulation of data in this notebook.

1. Subset data with df.loc[]
2. Concatenate or columns to create new features
3. Practice chaining methods
4. Practice multiple ways to get the same result:
  - Introduce 'df =' vs df.method(inplace=True)
  - Practice df['feature'] vs df.feature


## Tips
Don't solve it for them, let them struggle.  Show error messages and guide them toward how to read and deal with them.
