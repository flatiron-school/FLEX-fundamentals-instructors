# FLEX-fundamentals-instructors
Repository of notebooks to accompany FLEX fundamentals guided practice sessions.  These include solution notebooks and session notes readmes.

Note: 7/21/2021:

I added an intro to my Fundamental's section today and I think it really set the vibe:

Intro:
1. I am going to record this session, but it will not be posted publicly.  It's only for myself and other instructors to review so we can improve for next time!
   
2. Today we will be collaboratively completing a brief data science project that focuses on Python skills.
   
3. I will not be teaching you, or giving you answers.  You all will be working together and on your own to solve these problems, troubleshoot, and correct errors.  This is as much a chance to practice how you solve problems on your own as it is to practice actually coding.
   
4. This is a safe place to struggle and fail without consequences.
   
5. I expect you will use prior knowledge, your own problem solving skills, code documentation, and Google to complete this challenge.
   
6. If you all get stuck and no one knows how to proceed, I will try to give hints in the form of questions.  
   
7. We will be trading around who is sharing so you can talk us through your solutions, or so we can work together to understand documentation or solutions found online.
   
8. Thanks for coming!
   
9. First, was everyone able to fork and clone the repo and open the notebook?
