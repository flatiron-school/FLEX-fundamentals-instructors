## Learning Goals
1. Practice interpreting "word problems" and translating them into SQL queries
2. Query a database for table meta-information
3. Order and limit results
4. Aggregate and have SQL perform arithmetic on results
5. Use subqueries and joins to combine data from multiple tables


Session Outline/Plan
Students guide instructor on using basic pandas functions and methods to load, clean, and join two tables, then save it.
Students are encouraged to use documentation and Google, as well as error analysis to accomplish the goal together.
Students may need extra help downloading and storing the JSON in the beginning

Introduction (1 Mins)
Included in notebook.

### Activity 1 ~30 - 60 Mins? (depends on student proficiency)

Students should each have a copy of the notebook and be working along with the group.  

They should end with a functional notebook walking through the learning goals.  

Instructions for instructors to use the materials

Use solution as guidance, but allow students to determine what the instructor enters into code cells.  
This should be a collaborative creation, not instructor led.


### Activity 2 (30-60 Mins)

Conclusion (1 Mins)
Included in notebook

## Extras: 

## Tips
Don't solve it for them, let them struggle.  Show error messages and guide them toward how to read and deal with them.
