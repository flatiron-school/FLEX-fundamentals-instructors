## Learning Goals
1. load data from disk
2. determine length of a string
3. split and count words in a string
4. create a dictionary 
  1. loop over a list
  2. update a dictionary
  3. use a conditional statement
  4. return items in a dictionary as a list of tuples
5. sort a list of tuples by second element
6. create a simple graph with matplotlib

Session Outline/Plan
Students guide instructor on using basic python functions and methods to download, clean, and slice a text file, then save it to local disk.

Introduction (1 Mins)
Included in notebook.

### Activity 1 ~30-60 Mins? (depends on student proficiency)

Students should each have a copy of the notebook and be working along with the group.  

They should end with a functional notebook walking through the learning goals.  

## Instructions for instructors to use the materials

Use solution as guidance, but allow students to determine what the instructor enters into code cells.  
**This should be a collaborative creation, not instructor led.**
Instructor may use guiding questions to help students solve problems

* What did you find on Google?
* What does the error say?
* Is the documentation on this helpful?

### Activity 2 (XX Mins)

If there is a lot of time left, create more graphs or functionalize graph.  Probably won't be a lot of time left.

Conclusion (1 Mins)
Included in notebook

## Extras: 
Also, feel free to do more manipulation of data in this notebook.

Up to instructor

## Tips
Don't solve it for them, let them struggle.  Show error messages and guide them toward how to read and deal with them.
There are multiple ways to reach the same goals.  Accept the students' answer, and consider whether introducing another way would be helpful or not.
