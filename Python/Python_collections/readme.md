## Learning Goals
1. Use Python packages to download information from the internet using an API
2. Transform JSON responses into Python dictionaries
3. Read JSONs.
4. Loop over dictionaries and lists
5. Produce counts and mean averages using counters and collection lengths


Session Outline/Plan
Students guide instructor on using basic pandas functions and methods to load, clean, and join two tables, then save it.
Students are encouraged to use documentation and Google, as well as error analysis to accomplish the goal together.
Students may need extra help downloading and storing the JSON in the beginning

Introduction (1 Mins)
Included in notebook.

### Activity 1 ~10 - 30 Mins? (depends on student proficiency)

Students should each have a copy of the notebook and be working along with the group.  

They should end with a functional notebook walking through the learning goals.  

Instructions for instructors to use the materials

Use solution as guidance, but allow students to determine what the instructor enters into code cells.  
This should be a collaborative creation, not instructor led.


### Activity 2 (30-60 Mins)

Conclusion (1 Mins)
Included in notebook

## Extras: 
If done early:
1. Create tuples of (charactername, species)
2. Create a set of unique species
3. Count number of characters of each species

## Tips
Don't solve it for them, let them struggle.  Show error messages and guide them toward how to read and deal with them.
